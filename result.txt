### The World Spins, Stock Markets Surge, and Biden Waxes Immigration

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up. From the melodramatic stages of international politics to the flamboyant floors of the stock exchange, today's news is a whirlwind of events you didn't know you cared about. Sit tight as we navigate through Biden's immigration reform, tech stocks soaring, and some intriguing international spycraft.

#### Biden’s Big Immigration Gambit

In a move sure to ruffle feathers on both sides of the political aisle, President Joe Biden is about to bestow legal status upon hundreds of thousands of immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens. Yes, you heard that right. This is the man who, just two weeks ago, implemented one of his harshest immigration policies: a blanket asylum ban on illegal border crossings. And now, in a classic election-year pirouette, Biden is donning the Santa Claus suit to give immigrant spouses work permits, deportation protections, and a golden ticket to apply for green cards.

Why, you ask? Because polling says Americans love legal spouses. This initiative could benefit immigrants who have lived here for over a decade but haven't reaped the fruits of previous programs. Republicans, predictably, have decried this as "mass amnesty." But let’s be honest, the real brilliance here lies in Biden's use of an immigration law loophole called "parole in place." It's almost as if Biden’s advisers took a page from Machiavelli’s "The Prince," but with a twist of modern-day legal finesse.

#### Nasdaq and S&P 500 Hit New Highs

While Biden was playing legislative Santa, tech stocks were doing their best impression of Elon Musk on a caffeine binge. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 both logged record highs, thanks to a stellar performance from chipmakers like Broadcom and Super Micro Computer. The Dow Jones was feeling the love too, albeit to a slightly lesser extent. All this comes as investors await a slew of central-bank decisions and retail-sales data, the latter of which might finally give us an indication of whether consumers are doing their patriotic duty by shopping 'til they drop.

So, what’s driving this euphoric rise? A heady mix of confidence in the economy, hopes for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, and big gains from tech behemoths like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Despite this joyride, some investors are nervous about the underlying market "breadth"—the percentage of stocks participating in the rally is actually falling. It's like the Titanic heading full steam ahead, but only the first-class passengers are enjoying the cruise.

#### Netanyahu Dissolves War Cabinet

Not to be outdone in the realm of dramatic politics, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismantled the war cabinet that was supposed to bring unity to Israel's fight against Hamas. It seems the unity was more theoretical than practical, as internal disagreements led to the resignation of key member Benny Gantz. Netanyahu, ever the political survivor, opted to scrap the war cabinet rather than face the potential nightmare of including far-right coalition members.

In the backdrop, U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein is trying to play international marriage counselor, visiting Israel and Lebanon to keep things from escalating with Hezbollah. Given the current rate of missile exchanges and rising body counts, the term "diplomatic efforts" feels about as effective as bringing a water pistol to a wildfire.

#### Apple’s Buy Now, Pay Later Goes Bye-Bye

Meanwhile, Apple has decided to call it quits on its Buy Now, Pay Later service, a mere year after its launch. Turns out, making it easy for people to split their payments over six weeks wasn’t the financial goldmine they’d hoped. Instead, Apple will let other companies like Affirm handle the micro-loan business. So if you were planning to buy the latest iPhone in four easy installments, you'll have to deal with Affirm’s terms, which, let’s be real, probably involve a small-print agreement written by Satan himself.

#### Russian Spies in Slovenia

If you thought spy games were the stuff of Hollywood, think again. In Slovenia, an ostensibly Argentine couple turned out to be elite Russian spies. This duo, posing as a normal family with an online art gallery and IT startup, were actually deep-cover agents, equipped with encrypted communication devices and wads of cash hidden in their refrigerator. This discovery could make any paranoid soul look at their quiet neighbors a bit differently.

The spy scandal has echoes of a 2010 FBI operation in the U.S., where Russian spies embedded themselves so deeply they might as well have taken up American citizenship. The revelations underscore that while we were busy doomscrolling on Twitter, international espionage was alive and well.

#### Musk and the SEC: Round Infinity

Elon Musk, ever the bad boy of Wall Street, is back in hot water with the SEC. This time, it's over his delayed disclosure of his Twitter stock purchases. The SEC is investigating whether Musk committed civil fraud by not disclosing his ownership on time, potentially saving himself millions. If Musk were a cat, he'd have run out of lives by now. If found guilty, he might be barred from serving as an officer of a public company—a penalty that would send shockwaves through the tech world.

#### Russia Suspends Dollar, Euro Trade

In retaliation to new U.S. sanctions, Russia has suspended trading in U.S. dollars and euros on its stock exchange. The U.S. Treasury’s fresh sanctions aim to choke off financial pathways for Russia's war machine. So if you were thinking of buying rubles with your pocket change, now’s probably not the best time.

#### Boeing’s CEO Search Hits Turbulence

Boeing is finding it harder than expected to replace outgoing CEO David Calhoun. Top candidates like GE’s Larry Culp have declined the role, making Boeing's leadership search look like an episode of "Survivor" with no survivors. The next CEO will inherit a litany of problems, from production delays to federal investigations. Good luck with that.

#### Pixar’s Box Office Comeback

In happier news, Pixar's "Inside Out 2" has smashed records, pulling in $155 million domestically in its opening weekend. This animated sequel is a rare bright spot in an otherwise lackluster summer box office, proving that even in 2024, people still crave a good cry over animated emotions.

#### Microsoft’s AI Empire

Lastly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella continues his quest for AI domination. Not content with just partnering with OpenAI, Microsoft is now building its own in-house AI powerhouse. Nadella’s moves have kept Microsoft at the forefront of AI, but it’s a high-stakes game with rivals like Google and Meta hot on their heels. Only time will tell if this gamble pays off or if Nadella has to reboot yet another grand strategy.

And there you have it—a daily dose of world events with enough sarcasm to make even the most stoic among us crack a smile. Tune in tomorrow for another round of “What in the World is Happening?”
